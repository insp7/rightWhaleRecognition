Remarks for Professor: 
Kindly ignore this notes document.
These are just some random notes I have collected which were beneficial for me to work on during the project.
Below each note point, I have tried my best to cite the source of the information.

Unlike many commonly cited classification tasks which is to 
classify images into different species (bird, tree leaves, dogs in ImageNet), 
this task is to classify images of the same species into different individuals. 
So the classifier must pick up the fine details of the 
callosity patterns regardless of image perspective and exposure etc.

Since the task was a bit confusing at first, let me reiterate it and clarify what it is: 
We're trying to identify which whale appears in each image, categorized by whaleID in our dataframe. 
We are not identifying whales by species, but instead whether it's Kayla, Takara, etc.

SOME CHALLENGES
Some of the labels only included a single image of the whale. 

The raw images from the dataset were a very large resolution. Operating on such images would
require massive processing power. In addition much of the visible area of each image was taken
up by the water.

These images were captured during several aerial surveys
and under different lighting and environmental conditions

In addition to these variations, there are many other obstacles, which make these images very
challenging. For instance, for many whales the head is not clear because the whale is blowing
water 

The size of the whale with respect to the background (such as the one in image B2) is another challenge.
