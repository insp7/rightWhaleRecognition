# NOTE TO PROFESSSOR: 
I created an entirely new repository to submit code, as I was getting some git conflict issues and was running low on time.
This was the previous repository: https://github.com/insp7/right-whale-recognition. It has all the commits and version history (incase if you were wondering why does this repo has only 1 commit)
Kindly consider this code. This is similar to that repo, with just me adding citations for the code and this one does not have a few of the newly explored preprocessing approaches for which I did not train the model anyways.

# Right Whale Recognition -- Kaggle Challenge (2015-17)
To identify endangered right whales in aerial photographs 

From Wikipedia:
Right whales comprise three species of substantial baleen whales within the genus Eubalaena:
the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica), and the Southern right whale (E. australis).

NOTE: I had tried to use these to further preprocess the data, however, that approach is incomplete and have not trained the model on that preprocessed data. It can be performed as future work.
